    <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2> 
    <div class="blogpost">
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
      <p >In a situation where I had information withheld from me: initially I’d felt hurt and irritated that information was withheld. But I recognised while they were not honest with me, in this circumstance they were also not honest with themselves as a shield from feeling hurt. I decided not to confront and approach it with understanding. On reflection I’m grateful to have let my feelings go and prioritise compassion.</p>
      
      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p>I don’t seem to hold culture close to my personal identity, my culture would mostly be what I’ve subliminally absorbed from my parents. I grew up in Auckland and my parents are from China, I would say through advice and hearing their stories they’ve influenced values in me such as self-reliance, determination, and generosity. In relation to identity, my family has influenced an appreciation for good food and for sharing it. Their manner of showing affection is often unspoken and it took me a long time to realise sharing a meal together is a way they express care. Outside of family, I am indebted to my friends for inspiring a love for adventure, authenticity, and great kindness.</p>
  
      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      <p>My VIA signature strengths are...
  
        <ol>
        <li> Love of learning: Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or formally; related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the tendency to add systematically to what one knows.</li>
        <li> Judgement: Thinking things through an examining them from all sides; not jumping to conclusions; being able to change one’s mind in light of evidence; weighing all evidence fairly.</li>
        <li> Humility: Letting one's accomplishments speak for themselves; not regarding oneself as more special than one is.</li>
        <li> Kindness: Doing favors and good deeds for others; helping them; taking care of them.</li>
        <li>Love: Valuing close relations with others, in particular those in which sharing & caring are reciprocated; being close to people.</li>
        </ol>
       
        Love of learning - Useful as I naturally feel excited to learn and try new things.<br>
        Judgement - Thinking things through and weighing evidence is a useful strength for problem solving. <br>
        Humility - I do prefer to let accomplishments speak for themselves. <br>
        Kindness - It’ll be great if I’m able to support others through the learning journey too. <br>
        Love -  I’ll remember to appreciate those around me who are supporting me through the learning journey.<br>
 
     <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
     <p>In the past I’ve had a dear teacher tell me I limit myself by having my ‘black thinking hat’ on too soon and for too long. I have tended to be critical about ideas before giving it a chance or a try. Over the years I’ve tried to consciously rewire my mind to not dismiss ideas before exploring it, even if it’s a little. Sometimes the ‘black hat’ creeps in without notice and I have to step back and reassess if it is affecting myself or others.  Another limitation is that I am naturally withdrawn and quiet, it takes a lot of energy to put myself out there and to be bold. I believe this can be easier with practice.</p>
 
     <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
     <p>In a group work setting with a fast approaching deadline: there was resistance from the team and I was realising I could not meet the deadline on my own effort. A strategy employed at the time was to set up a meeting where we defined the outcomes we needed to hit and then breaking these outcomes up into small digestible tasks.</p>
