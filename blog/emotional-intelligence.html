    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.healthline.com/health/eq-vs-iq#bottom-line">
      IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
