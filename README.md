# Dev Academy Foundations Blog
This repository serves as my personal Dev Academy Foundations blog, where I documented the start of my journey and share my assignments, reflections, and coding practice.

## Purpose of the blog
  * **Assignments and Reflections:** This blog provides a home for my assignments and reflections. I will use it to share my thoughts and insights gained from the learning process, and reflect on my progress as a student. It will serve as a personal repository of my growth and achievements over foundations.
  * **HTML and CSS Practice:** Additionally, this blog offers me a platform to practice HTML and CSS. I can experiment with designing and building a simple web page. While design is important, my primary focus will be on learning breadth rather than depth, keeping my learning objectives in mind.
