    <h2>Learning Plan</h2> 
    <div class="blogpost">
     <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not entirely clear what the career pathway may be at the moment but in the next few years I want to work towards a position that I find fulfilling first and foremost. I’m seeking a career pathway that is creative, progressive, and challenging. Also I’m seeking a pathway which has an ability to grow and evolve.
     </p>
     
     <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>
        Strengths - I enjoy observing ways people use tools/software differently and learning what I can to make my own workflows efficient. 
      <br>
        Limitations - I’m pretty quiet, I’ll push myself to get started in conversations.
     </p>

     <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
     <p>
      Everything haha. Words like mindfulness, communication and self-awareness come to mind. I’d like to work on mental-clarity and maintaining good balance. In the past my job had overwhelmingly influenced my mental space both at work and away from work, I’ve struggled with striking the right balance between work and life.
     </p>

     <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
     <p>
      I’ll manage my work productively by reviewing tasks ahead, setting daily goals in small objectives, and organising tasks by priority/importance. Interact with everyone honestly and kindly. If things are building up and getting to me: I’ll take a step back, take a breath, review what needs to be done and break it down into small digestible tasks.
      </p>

     <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
     <p>
      If I feel stuck or blocked on a task, I’ll reach out to my peers and facilitators for help in a timely way.
      </p>

     <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
     <p>
      To be supportive, knowledgeable to the best of their abilities, and communicate clear expectations.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
      <p>
        In the evenings: I’d like to commit to spending some time with family and loved ones.
      <br>
        Friday nights: my friends routinely catch up to finish the week.
