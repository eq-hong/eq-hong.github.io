    <h2>Learning Plan | Bootcamp</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p><i>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</i></p>
    <p>
      My long term goal is career oriented, I am hoping to use the skills I gain during this course to find a mentally fulfilling job and also just honestly, find work that offers higher salaries to support myself and family. Generally speaking I'd like to make a positive impact when I leave Dev Academy. Any immediate impact would be tied to improving mine and my family's situation, currently I haven't given much thought to broader impacts. In relation to having a destination in mind, in the really-long term I eventually hope to be a part of projects which can improve the world. I'd like to explore opportunities in both front-end and back-end development.
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p><i>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</i></p>
    <p>I posted super brief bulletpoints for strengths and limitations in sprint 2. My idea of these haven't changed.</p>
    <p>Identifying new strengths: I'm pretty stubborn when I haven't understood something and if it feels important my brain won't stop spinning about it until I do understand it.</p>
    <p>New limitations: I've found asking for help to be anxiety inducing, I have to feel like I've exhausted every avenue myself before asking. I found sometimes I don't have the energy to do just that and it results in paralysis/overthinking and it isn't time efficient.</p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p><i>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.</i></p>
    <p>The first thing that does come to mind is in relation to keeping to a healthy sleeping routine. While working on my own I find my mind is sluggish in the morning (regardless of how much sleep I've gotten…) and much more efficient at night, which evolved into a later sleeping schedule over foundations. This may just be related to having freedom to manage myself. I had no issues focusing or working during mornings at my previous job, so when there is a more attendance-required structure in place I imagine I'll adjust to suit. I would like to start practicing a “close the day” ritual so I'm not lingering/stressing late into the night.</p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p><i>At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?</i></p>
    <p><i>For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.</i></p>
    <p>I would like to improve on communication and improving self-awareness and reflective skills.</p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p><i>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.</i></p>
    <p>Same as foundations: To be supportive, knowledgeable to the best of their abilities, and communicate clear expectations.</p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p><i>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</i></p>
    <p><i>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</i></p>
    <p>I'm in the online cohort so I imagine communication will primarily continue on Discord, I'll be able to contact peers and facilitators by messaging in the relevant chat groups or by DMs. In relation to Tech, I am looking forward to 1:1 time with a teacher for feedback on technical progress which is scheduled at the end of each phase. And I note you can ask for these at any point in the course.</p>
    <p>As per foundations: I'll manage my work productively by reviewing tasks ahead, setting daily goals in small objectives, and organising tasks by priority/importance. Interact with everyone honestly and kindly. If things are building up and getting to me: I'll take a step back, take a breath, review what needs to be done and break it down into small digestible tasks.</p>

    <h2>Learning Plan | Foundations</h2> 

    <div class="blogpost">
     <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not entirely clear what the career pathway may be at the moment but in the next few years I want to work towards a position that I find fulfilling first and foremost. I'm seeking a career pathway that is creative, progressive, and challenging. Also I'm seeking a pathway which has an ability to grow and evolve.
     </p>
     
     <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>
        Strengths - I enjoy observing ways people use tools/software differently and learning what I can to make my own workflows efficient. 
      <br>
        Limitations - I'm pretty quiet, I'll push myself to get started in conversations.
     </p>

     <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
     <p>
      Everything haha. Words like mindfulness, communication and self-awareness come to mind. I'd like to work on mental-clarity and maintaining good balance. In the past my job had overwhelmingly influenced my mental space both at work and away from work, I've struggled with striking the right balance between work and life.
     </p>

     <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
     <p>
      I'll manage my work productively by reviewing tasks ahead, setting daily goals in small objectives, and organising tasks by priority/importance. Interact with everyone honestly and kindly. If things are building up and getting to me: I'll take a step back, take a breath, review what needs to be done and break it down into small digestible tasks.
      </p>

     <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
     <p>
      If I feel stuck or blocked on a task, I'll reach out to my peers and facilitators for help in a timely way.
      </p>

     <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
     <p>
      To be supportive, knowledgeable to the best of their abilities, and communicate clear expectations.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
      <p>
        In the evenings: I'd like to commit to spending some time with family and loved ones.
      <br>
        Friday nights: my friends routinely catch up to finish the week.
