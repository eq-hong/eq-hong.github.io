    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

  <div class="blogpost">
    
    <h3>1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    <p>The problem I was blocked on was in the JS Kata Gradebook. The test wouldn't proceed when I'd called a function because I didn't realise the test was already calling the function. The problem solving techniques I first tried using was googling and trying different things out. I felt like I'd exhausted my capacity to search after an hour or so and decided to ask help. Through the process I felt worn out not being able find a solution to what seemed to be a simple task on my own and due to that I felt irrationally stressed asking for help. I think I can learn to loosen my ego and not be afraid to ask for help, everyone is also incredibly supportive and kind.</p>
    
    <h3>2. A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
    <p>A problem that I solved not quite elegantly but smoothly was after I realised how to use console.log (and rubber ducky method). In my first attempt at super fizzbuzz I'd tried to repeat code from an earlier function and I didn't manage to get it working for an array. While I did learn later that it's better to map repeating code, I was adamant about making my first attempt to work to get a better understanding of it. I poured a few hours googling and blindly trying different things. Reading existing discussions on Discord helped put me on the right track but I still struggled to get a working solution. I spoke to my partner about how I felt blind while working on the code and then it clicked that I could use console.log. I used console.log to inspect parts of a working solution to figure out why my first attempt at super fizzbuzz wasn't and then solved it relatively quickly.</p>

    <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
    <p><ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Pseudocode</span> 2/5<br>
        I'm still trying to grasp how to use/write pseudocode effectively.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Trying something</span> 4/5<br> 
        I'm comfortable testing different things to see if it might work.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Rubber ducky method</span> 3/5<br>
        This week I've found talking with another person helps a lot when I'm blocked and I'm adjusting to talking to an inanimate object.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Reading error messages</span> 3/5<br>
        I feel there are still things to learn and understand about JavaScript before I can intuitively work out what error messages are communicating.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Console.logging</span> 4/5<br>
        Realising how to use console.log was a game changer for me this week.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Googling</span> 5/5<br> I'm confident using Google.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Asking your peers for help</span> 3/5<br>
        A 3/5 this week as asking for help in Discord felt like asking into a void.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Asking coaches for help</span> 4/5<br>
        I like to exhaust most options before asking a coach, so far everyone's been very kind and approchable.</li><br>
      <li><span class="bold">Improving your process with reflection</span> 4/5<br>
        I find it's useful to reflect and re-read reflections as a way to track personal progress.
      </li>
